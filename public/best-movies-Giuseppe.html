<h1>BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO PEPPE</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time </h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Man on fire</h3>
<p>Best performance by Danzel Washington and Dakota Fanning.<br/>
Tony Scott did a great job.<br/>
Amazing soundtrack.</p>

<h3>Philadelphia</h3>
<p>Maybe the saddest movie ever,but the soundtrack,the performances by all the actors and the story are just breathtaking.</p>

<h3>Goodfellas</h3>

<p>We could have picked any Scorsese movie,they all superb.<br/>
I choose Goodfellas because of the cast(everyone was in their prime),the story,the timing...Everything is just perfect.
